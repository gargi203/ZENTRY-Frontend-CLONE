# 🚀 ZENTRY-Frontend-CLONE

A **React + Vite** powered frontend clone of the [ZENTRY website](https://zentry.com) — recreating its sleek UI, animations, and interactivity with modern web technologies.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project mimics the core visual and functional experience of ZENTRY, featuring:

- 🧭 Responsive and animated navigation bar with scroll-based visibility
- 🎨 Polygon-shaped animated feature cards with smooth hover tilts
- 🎥 Immersive looping and muted video backgrounds
- ✨ Animated titles and seamless fade effects for polished UI
- 🔗 Social and contact sections modeled after the original site

## 🔨 What I Implemented

### ✨ GSAP Animations

- Smooth show/hide navbar animations reactive to scrolling 🚦
- 3D hover tilt effects on cards driven by mouse movements 🖱️
- Text animation sequences with fade and blend modes 🧑‍🎨
- Leveraged easing functions & timelines for smooth interaction control

### 🔺 Polygon & Shape Effects

- Created polygon-shaped UI cards using CSS clip-path and layering 🔷
- Coordinated hover and mouse events for dynamic polygon transforms
- Achieved a distinctive layered aesthetic resembling the original UI

### 🎬 Video Integration

- Embedded looped, muted video backgrounds for dynamic sections 📹
- Managed autoplay behavior using React refs and proper asset placement
- Ensured smooth playback and controlled video states for UX fidelity

### 🧩 Component Architecture

- Modular React components: `Navbar`, `BentoCard`, `BentoTilt`, `Features` 🏗️
- State and lifecycle management using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) ⚙️
- Responsive styling using Tailwind CSS utility classes 📐
